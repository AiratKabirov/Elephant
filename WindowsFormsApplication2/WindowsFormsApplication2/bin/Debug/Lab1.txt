A somber mood pervaded the Headmistress's office. Minerva had returned after dropping off Draco and Narcissa at St. Mungo's, where the Lady Malfoy was being examined to see if a decade living as Muggle had done any damage to her health; and Harry had come up to the Headmistress's office again and then... not been able to think of priorities. There was so much to do, so many things, that even Headmistress McGonagall didn't seem to know where to start, and certainly not Harry. Right now Minerva was repeatedly writing words on parchment and then erasing them with a handwave.
