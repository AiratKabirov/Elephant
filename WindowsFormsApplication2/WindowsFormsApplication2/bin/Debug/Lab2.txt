The first part of the mission, to find an Occlumency instructor, had been a success. Professor Quirrell, smiling evilly, had told Griphook to recommend the best he knew, and not worry about the expense, since Dumbledore was paying it; and the goblin had smiled in return. The second part of the plan had been a com-plete failure. Harry was not allowed to take money out of his vault without Head-master Dumbledore or some other school official present, and Professor Quirrell had not been given the vault key. Harry's Muggle parents could not authorize it be-cause they were Muggles, and Muggles had around the same legal standing as children or kittens: they were cute, so if you tortured them in public you could get arrested, but they weren't people. Some reluctant provision had been made for rec-ognizing the parents of Muggleborns as human in a limited sense, but Harry's adoptive parents did not fall into that legal category. Professor Quirrell had inter-rupted at this point, saying that it was time for lunch, and swiftly conducted a fum-ing Harry out of the bronze doors of Gringotts, and to a fine restaurant called Mary's Place, where a room had been reserved for them.
